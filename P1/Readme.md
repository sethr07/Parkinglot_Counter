Parking Lot counter Simple FSM for deteting enter or exit from photolectric sensors fromt he parking lot. FSM in taks in the two inputs from the sensors, clock signal, reset signal and gives two outputs; increase or decrease. The counter comes into play. It is a 4 bit up down counter. It takes in inc, dec, reset from the fsm and a clock signal. Output is the count. There is a toplevel module which insantiates these two modules.

Each module is tested individualluy and there is a top level testbench as well. After through testing, it then target oto the basys3 board for display of car count, using the buttons on the board to mimic the sensors amd using the seven seg display to display the count itself.
